#####DESCRIPTION
---
As a Mac 'Fanboy' (I hate that word) I always use Mac images and icons within my projects, but sometimes I want something simple, flat and 0% intrusive in the design.

So I made this. A simple template in sketch, exportable to AI, SVG and all common formats for the 3 Mac models that you see in the image:

Now I present *Mac Sketches*, featuring:

+ 3 versions: Regular, Outline & Bold.
+ All 3 versions contains 3 Mac models (more upcoming): Macbook 13", Macbook 11" and Mac Mini.
+ Full JPG, PNG & SVG versions.
+ All versions includes a @2x file to use the sketches in Retina Display compatible apps & websites.
